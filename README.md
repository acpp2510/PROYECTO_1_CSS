# 🎨 Project: Where is my CSS?

---

### 📌 Project Overview

**What are we going to do?**  
Continuing with the same team from the _Where is my HTML?_ project, we will design and apply CSS styles to the existing Log In form, following a provided HTML structure.

**Where are we going to do it?**  
We will work in a CSS file that will be saved inside a specific folder within the project.

**How are we going to do it?**  
We will use **CSS3** properties and tags to style the form, including:

- Positioning  
- Colors  
- Typography  
- Spacing  
All while ensuring a **responsive** and **visually appealing** design.

**What tools are we going to use?**  
- **CSS3**  
- A text editor such as **Visual Studio Code**  
> ⚠️ The HTML file must not be modified. Only CSS will be added via an external stylesheet.

**How will the project be evaluated?**  
The evaluation will be based on:

- Proper application of CSS styles  
- Code organization and clarity  
- Design consistency with the given HTML structure  
- Ability to maintain a responsive layout
